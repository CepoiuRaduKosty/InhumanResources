  added to the navigational pane of the administrative console.  To edit the fields of this dialog, you must disconnect the administration console from the object store and then display the dialog again.</P>

<P><b>JNDI Naming Service Properties</b>: Use the controls in this area to define the
  list of JNDI properties for this object store. Use the <b>Name</b> drop down list 
  to select a property name. After selecting the property name, use the <b>Value</b> 
  field to enter the property value.</P>

  information. However, if you are concerned about security, you can wait to be 
  prompted for this information at connect time.</p>
<ul>

    to add the property to the table.</li>
