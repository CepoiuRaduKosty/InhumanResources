<H2>Broker Destination Properties &gt; <BR>Basic</H2>
 
<P>This tab displays information about a broker destination. You can also use 
  it to change properties that you defined for a destination using the <b>Add 
  Broker Destination</b> dialog.</P>

<p><b>Destination Name</b> Specifies the name of the physical destination.</p>
<p><b>Destination Type</b> Specifies the destination type (queue or topic). </p>
<p><b>Destination State</b> Specifies whether the destination is active or paused 
  (paused producers, paused consumers, or both)</p>

<P>
<hr>
<p><b>Current Number of Messages</b> Specifies the number of unconsumed messages 
  currently in this destination.</p>
<p><b>Current Total Message Bytes</b> Specifies the total amount of memory used 
  by unconsumed messages currently in this destination.</p>
<p><b>Current Number of Producers</b> Specifies the number of producers currently 
  associated with this destination.</p>
<p><b>Current Number of Consumers</b> Specifies the number of consumers currently 
  associated with this destination. This includes non-durables, and active/inactive 
  durables (topic only).</p>
<p><b>Current Number of Active Consumers</b> Specifies the number of active consumers currently associated with this destination (queue only).</p>
<p><b>Current Number of Backup Consumers</b>: Specifies the number of backup consumers 
  currently associated with this destination (queue only).</p>
<P>
<hr>
<p><b>Max Number of Messages</b> Specifies the maximum number of unconsumed messages 
  allowed in this destination. </p>
<p><b>Max Total Message Bytes </b> Specifies the maximum total amount of memory 
  allowed for unconsumed messages in this destination. Use the drop down list 
  to select the unit of measurement: bytes, kbytes, or megabytes.</p>
<p><b>Max Bytes per Message</b> Specifies the maximum size of any single message 
  allowed in this destination. Use the drop down list to select the unit of measurement: 
  bytes, kbytes, or megabytes.</p>
<p><b>Max Number of Producers</b> Specifies the maximum number of producers allowed 
  for this destination.</p>
<p><b>Max Number of Active Consumers </b> Applies to queue destinations only. 
  Specifies the maximum number of consumers that can be active in load-balanced 
  delivery from this destination.</p>
<p><b>Max Number of Backup Consumers </b> Applies to queue destinations only. 
  Specifies the maximum number of backup consumers that can take the place of 
  active consumers, should any active consumers fail during load-balanced delivery 
  from this destination.</p>
<P>
<hr>
<P><b>Limit Behavior</b>
Specifies how the broker responds when a memory-limit threshold is reached for this destination. Values are: 
<UL>
  <li>FLOW_CONTROL - slows down producers</li>
  <li>REMOVE_OLDEST - throws out oldest messages</li>
  <li>REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY - throws out lowest priority messages according to age of the messages (producing client receives no notification of message deletion)</li>  
  <li>REJECT_NEWEST - rejects the newest messages (producing client gets exception for rejection of persistent messages, but no notification for rejection of non-persistent messages</li>
  
</ul>

<p><b>Use Dead Message Queue</b> Specifies the use of a dead message queue for the destination.</p>

<p>When a message is deemed undeliverable, it is automatically placed on a special 
  queue called the dead message queue. A message placed on this queue retains 
  all of its original headers (including its original destination) and information 
  is added to the message's properties to explain why it became a dead message. 
  An administrator or a developer can access this queue, remove a message, and 
  determine why it was placed on the queue.</p>

<p>The dead message queue is automatically created by the system and is named
<code>mq.sys.dmq</code>.</p>

<hr>
