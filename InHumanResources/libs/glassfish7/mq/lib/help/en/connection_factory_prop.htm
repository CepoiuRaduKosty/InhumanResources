<P>Use this dialog to reconfigure connection factory properties that you have 
  already set using the Add Connection Factory dialog.</P>

<P><b>Read-Only</b> Click this check box to make the factory connection object 
  read-only. If the object is read only, client applications will not be able 
  to modify connection factory attributes through api calls. </P>

<p>By reconfiguring a connection factory object, you redefine the properties common 
  to all the connections that the factory produces. You use the tabs shown in 
  the dialog to reconfigure the connection factory. Click one of the following 
  links for information about a particular tab.</p>
