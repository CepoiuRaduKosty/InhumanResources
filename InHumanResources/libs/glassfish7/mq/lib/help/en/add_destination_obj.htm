<H2>Add Destination Object</H2>
 
<P>Use this dialog to add a destination object to an object store. </P>

<P>A <i>destination administered object</i> is a provider-independent representation 
  of a physical destination (a queue or a topic) in a broker. </P>

<P><b>Lookup Name</b> Use this field to specify the JNDI lookup name of the administered 
  object. This name can be the same as the destination name; the only stricture 
  is that it must be unique in the object store's context. </P>

<P><b>Destination Type</b> Click the radio button that corresponds to the destination's 
  type: queue or topic. </P>

<P><b>Read-Only</b> Click this check box to make the object read-only. If the 
  object is read only, client applications will not be able to modify administered 
  object attributes through api calls. </P>

<P><b>Destination Name</b> Use this field to specify the name of the physical 
  destination on the broker to which this administered object corresponds. If 
  you do not specify a name, the default name of <code>Untitled_Destination_Object</code> 
  is used. </P>

<P><b>Destination Description</b> Use this field to enter a useful description
  of this destination object.</P>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>Reset To Defaults</b> button to reset all fields to their default 
    value. </li>
  <li> Click <b>OK</b> to create the destination object. </li>
</ul>

<p>To change the properties of a destination object </p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the Destinations folder in the navigational pane of the administration 
    console. </li>
  <li>Select the destination object in the results pane of the administration 
    console. </li>
  <li>Choose <b>Actions &gt; Properties</b> to bring up the Destination Object Properties 
    dialog. </li>
</ol>
